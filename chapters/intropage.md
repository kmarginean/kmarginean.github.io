# Studio K
A little workshop of potential literature in the lineage of Oulipo

## About Oulipo
Oulipo (_Ouvroir de littérature potentielle_, or _Workshop of Potential Literature_) is a French literary movement founded in 1960 that explores writing through formal constraints. Its members use mathematical, logical, and structural rules -like lipograms, permutations, and combinatronics- to generate new literary possibilities. The goal is not limitation for its own sake, but the discovery of unexpected creativity produced by constraint.

> "Exhaustion is the necessary corollary to the Oulipian concept of potential. The constraint acts as a rubber band, expanding around the contours of the work as it pursues exhaustion, stretching to its limits; then it's snapped, and the work's potential sails out into the world. The constraint creates an environment in which creation can be helped along." > -- from _The End of Oulipo?_ by Scott Esposito and Lauren Elkin

## Favorite Constraints
A few of my favorite constraints from the [comprehensive library](https://oulipo.net/fr/contraintes/99-notes-preparatoires) on the Oulipo website. 

99 preparatory notes
: The form known as the "99 Preparatory Notes" lies somewhere between a poem and an essay, taking hold of a given subject and attempting to exhaust its potential through a polyphonic exploration.

It is not "constrained" in the strict sense, but rather has much to do with potentiality. The obligation to write ninety-nine sentences on a specific theme thus brings it closer to an attempt at exhaustion. One must then find a way to order (or unorder) these notes. That said, nothing prevents the use of specific constraints locally, for example, by playing with numbering.
